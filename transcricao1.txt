 This is the Dunning Kruger effect, and it might explain why smart people like you think that you might be stupid sometimes. So this cognitive bias was discovered by psychologists David Dunning and Justin Kruger in 1999. They found that people who were worse at something often overestimate how good they are, but those with a high ability tend to underestimate it. For example, with the rise of easy-to-use investment apps, many amateur investors might think that they've actually cracked the code to making millions in the stock market, but actually season investors understand the unpredictability and complexities involved in long-term success, but someone who's been working out for a few weeks might feel like they know everything about exercise and nutrition, but actually dedicated athletes and trainers continuously learn and adapt their routines, and they're always aware there's something more to discover. So Dunning and Kruger observed that those who are highly skilled realise just how much they don't know, because the more you learn, the more you uncover the complexity and vastness of a subject, which makes you feel like a small fish in a big pond. But on the flip side, those of us who are less skilled are blissfully unaware of our own ignorance, and we feel like a big fish in a tiny puddle. Do you think your guilty of this?
