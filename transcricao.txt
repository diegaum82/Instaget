 My YouTube videos are not very edited. They take me, and this is not a lie, 40 minutes to edit. From idea to sitting down and filming to video being published with title thumbnail, everything, it's like two and a half hours. I do it after lunch on Friday. My mindset on YouTube is even though yes, I'm probably losing the monkey brain people that need stimulation every two and a half seconds. I would rather build an audience of people that are willing to click on my video, sit and watch it, than a group of people that need to be tricked to watch through the entire video. Because the kind of people that need to be tricked to watch through the entire video, are probably not gonna buy your products. At the expense of quick growth right now, you probably wanna focus on building a really good audience around something that's reasonably easy to make. What would your dream business look like? Like my dream YouTube channel would look like it takes me two and a half hours to make a video. Not it takes me 11 hours to plan two hours to shoot and then my editors two weeks to edit. That sounds like a fucking horrible business.
